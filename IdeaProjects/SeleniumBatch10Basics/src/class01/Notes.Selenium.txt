c.it requires a rc server


3.SELENIUM Webdriver
a.support differnet browsers
b.it will support differnet languages

4.SELENIUM GRID
1.consist of a node and hub
2.run test cases in parallel on differnt browsers


Selnium 1
Selnium2--> Selenium RC and webDriver (combined)
Selnium3-->  some improvemnets in Selnium 2
Selnium4--> some changes and improvemnets in the communication protocols


Advantages of Selnium:
  --Open Source
  --Compatible with different languages (java, ruby,C#)
  --It allows you to have your test cases run on differnt browsers (firefox, opera, chrome e.t.c)
  --its not OS dependent (windows, MAC,LINUX)

Disadvantages of Selenium:
  --No technical support
  --We can not test desktop applications
  --no  built in reports

  Selinium Architecture :



----------close() vs quit()

      driver.close()-->it will close the current tab that we are on

      driver.quit()--> it will simply close the whole browser


----------get() vs navigate()
--using navigate we can move forward, backward and refresh the page
  but using get we can not do that



    TASK----------
Create a new class named MissionImpossible

    /**
     * 1. launch the browser
     * 2. navigate to amazon web site
     * 3. print out the title and the url in the console
     * 4. close the browser
     */


     --all webpages are made of usually HTML,CSS and js

     we have tags in HTML
     1.tags have differnet purposes i.e to define headings, pragraphs, picture e.t.c
    ** we must have a opening and a closing tag
     <html>

     </html>

            <name>hasim</name>
     </listofstudents>

What are webElements?
What are locators?

*****XPATH******
Why do we need XPath locator?
--developers may not have provided other locators in the html
--by using xpath we can identify those webelements easily

What is an xpath?
Xpath is just like a query language that help u to identify elements


Types of Xpath:
1.Absolute Xpath
-->starts with a starting node in html
it starts with a single slash
(/)
e.g /html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/form/div[2]/button

2.Relative xpath
Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']

Example:
//input[@type='password']
hey can u find me the tag input who has an attribute "type" with the
attribute value "password"

identify the element by its text:
//tagname[text()='text value']
hey can u find me the tag a which has text of value "text value"

Example:
//a[text()='Alerts & Modals']

idenitfying elements using contain method
//tagname[contains(@attribute,'attribute value')]
Example:
//tagname[contains(@attrbiute,"sometext")]
hey can u find me the tag which has the attribute "attribute" and it value contains "sometext"
